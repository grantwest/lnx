Bitcoin lightning network implemented in elixir.
I am publishing my progress into the public domain in case someone else decides to take up the challenge.

Parts implemented here:

- LN Noise Protocol (key exchange)
- LN Onion Routing
- LN message encode/decode
- Peer connections
- Opening a channel

This code might be useful to someone who wants to interact with LN nodes via the peer protocol in elixir.
